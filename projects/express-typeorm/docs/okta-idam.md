## Access Management

### Scopes

OpenID Connect uses scope values to specify which access privileges are being requested for access tokens.

The scopes associated with access tokens determine the claims that are available when they are used to access the 
OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint.

See: [Okta OIDC Scopes](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#scopes)
