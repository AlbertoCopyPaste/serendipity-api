### Getting Started

Jaspersoft Studio is an Eclipse-based report designer for JasperReports; it's available as an Eclipse plug-in or as a 
stand-alone application.

[Download](https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio/releases) the Community Edition of Jaspersoft

In Jaspersoft Studio select Preferences => Jaspersoft Studio => Fonts and then click the Add button:

**Note:** It has been my experience that you can't use custom fonts directly but that you must create a style and then apply that style to an element.
